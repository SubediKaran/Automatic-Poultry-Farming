## INTRODUCTION
In the recent years, the chicken production in the world has been increasing gradually because of standardized farming management and good manufacturing practices. The Chicken poultry industry is an important industry for sustainable food supply in our country. The development of an automatic chicken feeding machine can be very useful to the growth of the poultry industry. This paper highlights the technology-based solution for low cost, asset saving, quality oriented and productive management of chicken framing. 
This study intended to explore utilizing an Intelligent System which uses an Embedded Framework and Smart Phone for monitoring chicken farm to control environmental parameters using smart devices and technologies as well as automation in feeding and water supply to the farm. The use of proposed system can replace the worker for feeding and water supply the chicken thus overcome the labor problems in the industry and introduce a semi-automatic process in the poultry industry. The Proposed system can be applicable in Poultry Farm and agriculture sector. In poultry farm , it is used to feed the food in container, feed water in nipple waterer, maintain the temperature and humidity using fans and heater, maintain automatic lighting as well as monitoring real time environment situation through smart devices by accessing data updated in IoT cloud. Through this proposed system it will be helpful to the user.
Keywords: Poultry, Temperature, Humidity, Automation, Feeding, Water Supply, Automatic Lighting, IoT.
